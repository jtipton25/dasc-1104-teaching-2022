```{r setup, include=FALSE}

There are issues when sharing files that are created on Windows machines when using the file on a linux-based machine (including MacOS). This is related to the way a computer defines a new line (`\n` in linux and `\r\n` on Windows).

To get to the options to change the line files, open the settings by clicking the gear icon in the lower left and then choose settings.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "VS-settings.png"))
```

Once the settings window opens, in the search bar at the top of the window, search for `end of line` and hit return. This will open a bunch of options. In the option `Files: Eol` there will be a drop-down menu. Choose the drop down menu and select the `\n` option. At the bottom of the drop-down menu, this will then show `LF`. 

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "VS-settings-end-of-line.png"))
```


Open up a new python script and verify that the end of line file type is `LF` in the lower menu bar. If the end of line file type shows `CRLF`, quit and restart VS code. If the end of line file is still `CRLF` repeat the process listed above.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "VS-settings-LF.png"))
```
