<!-- # FAQ week 1 -->

# Make sure you read this document before sending me an email. These are the most common issues that arise during this course so there is a high likelhood that your issue will be here.


# I can't connect to the server when I'm off home/coffee shop/anywhere not using UARK WIFI {#vpn}

* Download and install the UARK VPN. If you are off campus, are you logged into the VPN? Double check
    
```{r, warning = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "FAQs", "vpn.png"))
```

# Server disconnected

I keep getting the error message below. What gives?

```{r, out.width = "70%", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "FAQs", "r-disconnected.png"))
```

The above message can arise for multiple reasons. The most common are 

1) I, the instructor, have logged into your RStudio server account to either help you with a problem or to see what progress you have made. If you had an active connection and then get booted off a couple times in a row, I am likely working on your account.

2) You have a poor internet connection and/or you are [not on the VPN](#vpn)

3) There is an error on the server end. If this occurs for more than a few minutes and you are either on campus or logged into the VPN, send me an email


# You get the error: `! LaTeX Error: File 'framed.sty' not found.`

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "70%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "FAQs", "framed-error.png"))
```

- Make sure you have installed `tinytex` package and have installed `tinytex` by copying the code below and pasting it into the R console (lower left window)

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("tinytex")
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```

- Finally, close your RStudio session and then start a new session

- [More detailed instructions are available in this video](https://video.uark.edu/media/Installing+tinytex/0_1uq0t36z)


<!-- # Have you tried restarting your session and running all code chunks upto where you are working? -->

<!-- # My Rmarkdown document won't knit -->

<!-- 1) Make sure you have  -->
<!--     1) created a project,  -->
<!--     1) are in your active project,  -->
<!--     1) all the files needed for the analysis are in you active project in their correct folders, -->
<!--     1) and the Rmarkdown file you are actively editing is in your project directory -->

<!-- 1) In the Rmarkdown popup window (lower left corner), double click on the Error message. This will take you to the location in the RMarkdown document where the computer *thinks* you have an error -->

<!--     ```{r} -->
<!--     knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "FAQs", "knit-error.png")) -->
<!--     ``` -->

<!-- 1) If the above issues are not causing the problem, make sure all of your code chunks are closed (all code chunks start with ```` ```{r} ```` and end in ```` ``` ````) -->


<!-- # I get an error: -->

<!-- ## blah blah blah blah ... `could not find the function %>%` -->

<!-- ```{r, error = TRUE} -->
<!-- ## need to subset into the sinusitus into the treatment category of the group variable -->
<!-- sinusitis %>% -->
<!--   subset(group == "treatment") -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Oops, you forgot to load the tidyverse package (**As a note, you should add all packages to a code chunk at the top of your RMarkdown document**) I just have to add the library call here to get the error above -->

<!-- ```{r, message = FALSE} -->
<!-- library(tidyverse) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- **Note: when working in interactive mode (in the console) you need to make sure you load the library** -->


<!-- ## blah blah blah blah ... `data set 'orings' not found`  -->

<!-- ```{r, error = TRUE} -->
<!-- data("orings") -->
<!-- ``` -->


<!-- Oops, you forgot to load the package that contains the data (in this example, it is the `openintro` package) (**As a note, you should add all packages to a code chunk at the top of your RMarkdown document**) I just have to add the library call here to get the error above -->

<!-- ```{r, message = FALSE} -->
<!-- library(openintro) -->
<!-- data("orings") -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- **Note: when working in interactive mode (in the console) you need to make sure you load the library** -->


<!-- ## blah blah blah blah ... `object 'dat' not found`  -->

<!-- ```{r, error = TRUE} -->
<!-- dat %>% -->
<!--   subset(temp > 70) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- You have not defined an object in R named `dat`. If `dat` is a dataset, load it using `data("dat")`. If `dat` is a created object (i.e., the output of a function call), create the object dat. -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- dat <- orings %>% -->
<!--   subset(damage == 1) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- then you can use the object `dat`  -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- dat %>% -->
<!--   subset(temp > 70) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ## I can't find the data/I can't load the package/etc. in the console -->

<!-- If you are working interactively (in the console) pehaps you see something like this... -->

<!-- ```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "50%"} -->
<!-- knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "FAQs", "oringskms.png")) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- The previous code wasn't loading the `orings` data because the `openintro` library has not been loaded using the `library(openintro)` -->

<!-- The following code will produce an error because the `madeupdata` package doesn't actually exist. I use this example to show what the error message output will look like. -->

<!-- ```{r, error = TRUE} -->
<!-- # load the data pizzamustache from the madeupdata package -->
<!-- library(madeupdata) -->
<!-- ```     -->

<!-- To install a missing package, say the `openintro` package, type -->

<!-- ```{r, eval = FALSE} -->
<!-- install.packages("openintro")     -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- If you are still having issues, you run **all code chunks above the current chunk**, (or, if you are working interactively -- not on the RMarkdown document -- make sure you run the line `library(openintro)` in he console) -->



<!-- # How do make those annoying package loading messages go away -->

<!-- If you don't like the output of the package loading messages shown below (**I don't**) -->

<!-- ```{r, echo = FALSE} -->
<!-- detach("package:openintro", unload=TRUE) -->
<!-- ```  -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- library(openintro) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- disable these by adding the option `message = FALSE` to the chunk that loads the libraries. -->



<!-- ```` -->
<!-- `r ''````{r, message = FALSE} -->
<!-- library(openintro) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- ```` -->


<!-- # Formatting errors -->

<!-- **Don't print output that runs for many pages -- I will take off points for very poor formatting/proofreading.** -->

<!-- One option is to disable the output using the code chunk option `include = FALSE`. -->

<!-- ```` -->
<!-- `r ''````{r, include = FALSE} -->
<!-- sinusitis %>% -->
<!--   subset(group == "treatment") -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- ```` -->


<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- sinusitis %>% -->
<!--   subset(group == "treatment") -->
<!-- ``` -->
