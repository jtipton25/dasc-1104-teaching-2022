# Readings

* R for data science 
    * Introduction
    * Chapters 10 (Relational data with `dplyr`), 11 (Strings with `stringr`), 12 (Factors with `forcats`), and 13 (Dates and times with `lubridate`)
    
    
---

# Relational data

* Multiple tables of data where the relationships between the data matter

* Common in SQL and other database software

* Common operations include mutating joins, filtering joins, and set operations

* Example: `nycflights13` relational data

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)
```

---

# Examine the data

* The data sets include `airlines`, `airports`, `planes` and `weather`

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "80%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("./img/relational-nycflights.png")
```

---

# Relational data

* The `weather` data is connected to `flights` data by the variables `year`, `month`, `day`, `hour`, and `origin`

* The `planes` data is connected to the `flights` data by the `tailnum` variable

* The `airports` data is connected to the `flights` data by the `faa` variable

* The `airlines` data is connected to the `flights` data by the `carrier` variable

---

# Relational data

* The variables that connect two or more data tables are called **keys**

    * **primary keys** uniquely identifies an observation in its own table
    
    * **foreign keys** uniquely identifies an observation in another table

* A quick check if a variable is a key is to count it

```{r}
planes %>%
  count(tailnum) %>%
  filter(n > 1)
```

* The `tailnum` variable never shows up more than once in the `planes` data.
    
    
```{r}
airlines %>% 
  count(carrier) %>%
  filter(n > 1)
```

* The `carrier` variable never shows up more than once in the `airlines` data

---

# Question: What is the key for `flights`?

---

# The `flights` key

* There isn't a key

```{r}
flights %>%
  count(flight) %>% ## the flight number gets reused
  filter(n > 1)
```

---

# The `flights` key

* There isn't a key

```{r, cache = TRUE}
flights %>%
  count(year, month, day, flight) %>% ## the flight number gets reused
  filter(n > 1)
```


---

# The `flights` key

* There isn't a key

```{r, cache = TRUE}
flights %>%
  count(year, month, day, flight, tailnum) %>% ## the flight number gets reused
  filter(n > 1)
```



---

# The `flights` key

* If there isn't a key, you can make one (called a **surrogate key**)

.small[
```{r}
flights %>%
  mutate(row_number = row_number())
```

```{r, cache = TRUE}
flights %>%
  mutate(row_number = row_number()) %>%
  count(row_number) %>%
  filter(n > 1)
```
]


---

# Mutating joins

* Combines variable from two data tables

```{r}
# create a smaller dataset from flights
flights_smaller <- flights %>%
  select(year:day, hour, origin)
```
    
```{r}
flights_smaller
```

---

# Mutating joins

* Combines variables from two data tables

* Add variable columns to a dataset

```{r, cache = TRUE}
flights_smaller %>%
  left_join(weather, by = c("year", "month", "day", "hour", "origin"))
```

* Weather data appended to the `flights_smaller` data

---

# Types of joins

* Left join (join the two data sets keeping all variables in the left data set)

* Right join (join the two data sets keeping all variables in the right data set)

* Inner join (join the two data sets keeping all variables that are in both data sets)

    * Typically this is poor as it drops missing values silently
    
    * Missing values are important to keep track of -- only drop missing values intentionally

* Outer join (join the two data sets keeping all variables that are in either data set)

---

# Joins

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "35%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("./img/inner-join.png")
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "35%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("./img/join-outer.png")
```

---

# Example data


.pull-left[
```{r}
dat_x <- tribble(
  ~key, ~x,
  1, "x1",
  2, "x2",
  3, "x3",
  4, "x1",
  5, "x2",
  6, "x3",  
)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
dat_y <- tribble(
  ~key, ~y,
  1, "y1",
  2, "y2",
  3, "y3",
  4, "y1",
  7, "y2",
  8, "y3",  
)
```
]

---

# Inner Join

```{r}
dat_x %>%
  inner_join(dat_y, by = "key")
```
    
* Notice that the variables with keys 5-8 have been dropped

* Half of the data is now missing without any notice!

---

# Outer joins

* Left joins

    * Keeps all of the observations in the "left" dataset 

```{r}
dat_x %>%
  left_join(dat_y, by = "key")
```

* Notice how all the observations in `dat_x` are kept

---

# Outer joins

* Right joins

    * Keeps all of the observations in the "right" dataset 

```{r}
dat_x %>%
  right_join(dat_y, by = "key")
```

* Notice how all the observations in `dat_y` are kept
    
    
---

# Outer joins

* Full joins

    * Keeps all of the observations in both datasets

```{r}
dat_x %>%
  full_join(dat_y, by = "key")
```

* Notice how all the observations in `dat_x` and `dat_y` are kept 

---

# Duplicate keys

* Typically, there should not be duplicate keys, but this isn't always true



.pull-left[
```{r}
dat_x <- tribble(
  ~key, ~x,
  1, "x1",
  2, "x2",
  3, "x3",
  4, "x1",
  1, "x2",
  2, "x3",  
)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
dat_y <- tribble(
  ~key, ~y,
  1, "y1",
  2, "y2",
  3, "y3",
  5, "y5",
)
```
]

---

# Left Joins with duplicate keys

```{r}
dat_x %>%
  left_join(dat_y, by = "key")
```
    
* Notice that we get all combinations (Cartesian product) of the variables keeping all observations in `dat_x`

---

# Outer joins

* Right joins

    * Keeps all of the observations in the "right" dataset 

```{r}
dat_x %>%
  right_join(dat_y, by = "key")
```

* Notice how all the observations in `dat_y` are kept
    
    
---

# Outer joins

* Full joins

    * Keeps all of the observations in both datasets

```{r}
dat_x %>%
  full_join(dat_y, by = "key")
```

* Notice how all the observations in `dat_x` and `dat_y` are kept 


---

# Defining the key

* Most of the time, the key variable (or variables) are not given the name `key`

* A natural join uses all of the variables in the two dataframes that are in common

```{r}
flights_reduced <- flights %>% 
  select(year:day, hour, origin, dest, tailnum, carrier)
flights_reduced
```

---

# Natural join

* What are the key variables used here?

```{r}
flights_reduced %>%
  left_join(weather)
```

* Uses the variables in common between the datasets
---

# Natural join

```{r}
colnames(flights_reduced)
```

```{r}
colnames(weather)
```


* What variable names are in common

```{r}
intersect(colnames(flights_reduced), colnames(weather))
```


---

# Joining with keys

* left join `flights_reduced` and `planes`

* Notice the output of the `years` variables

```{r}
flights_reduced %>%
  left_join(planes, by = "tailnum")
```

---

# Joining with keys

* right join `flights_reduced` and `planes`

* Notice the output of the `years` variables

```{r}
flights_reduced %>%
  right_join(planes, by = "tailnum")
```

---

# Joining with keys with different names

* `flights_reduced` has variable `dest`, `airports` has the variable `faa`

* left join `flights_reduced` (`dest` variable) and `airports` (`faa` variable)

```{r}
flights_reduced %>%
  left_join(airports, by = c("dest" = "faa"))
```


---

# Filtering joins

* Filter joins drop observations that are missing (typically not used much)

* `semi_join(x, y)` keeps all observations in `x` that have a match in `y` 
    * Drops all observations in `x` that don't have a match in `y`
    * Does not duplicate observations (no Cartesian products)

* `anti_join(x, y)` drops all observations in `x` that have a match in `y`
    * useful for diagnosing join errors

---

# Working with joins

* Identifying keys
     * Use your knowledge of the data
     * Trying to identify keys based on the data values can lead to red herrings
     

---

# Strings

```{r}
string1 <- "This is a string"
string2 <- 'This is also a string'
string3 <- 'This is a "quoted" string'
```

```{r}
string1
string2
string3
```

---

# Strings - Escape characters

* The escape character for strings is `\`

* Note: printed strings show the escape characters, not the string

```{r}
print(string3)
```

* To show the actual string, use `writelines`

```{r}
writeLines(string3)
```

* Other special characters include `\n`, `\t`

---

# Strings 

* Join strings into a vector using `c()`

```{r}
c(string1, string2, string3)
```

* String length (number of characters) using `str_length()`

```{r}
str_length(c(string1, string2, string3, NA))
```

* Join strings together using `str_c()`

```{r}
str_c(string1, string2, string3)
```

* Join strings with a separator character

```{r}
str_c(string1, string2, sep = "\n")
```

---

# Strings

* Missing values (`NA`) are contagious

* The `str_c()` function (like most R functions) are vectorized

```{r}
str_c("abc", c("var", NA), "def", sep = "-")
```

* Collapse a vector of strings using `collapse`

```{r}
str_c(c("abc", "def", "ghi"), collapse = ", ")
```

---

# Subsetting strings

* Subset strings using `str_sub()`

```{r}
beatles <- c("John", "Paul", "Ringo", "George")
# select the 1st through 3rd characters, inclusive
str_sub(beatles, 1, 3)
```

```{r}
# select the last through 3rd from last characters, inclusive
str_sub(beatles, -3, -1)
```

* Convert string to lower case

```{r}
str_to_lower(beatles)
```

* Can use subsetting in assignment

```{r}
str_sub(beatles, 1, 1) <- str_to_lower(str_sub(beatles, 1, 1))
beatles
```

---

# Sting manipulation 

.pull-left[

* `str_to_lower()`

```{r}
str_to_lower(beatles)
```

* `str_to_upper()`

```{r}
str_to_upper(beatles)
```

* `str_to_title()`

```{r}
str_to_title(beatles)
```
]

.pull-right[

* `str_sort()`

```{r}
str_sort(beatles)
```

* `str_order()`

```{r}
str_order(beatles)
```

]


---

# Strings and searching

* To help troubleshoot string searches, the functions `str_view()` and `str_view_all()` are useful

```{r}
costumes <- c("skeleton", "zombie", "witch", "ghoul", "ghost", "ghastly ghoul", "post man")
str_view(costumes, "gh")
```

---

# Strings and searching

.pull-left[ 
```{r}
str_view(costumes, "e")
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
str_view_all(costumes, "e")
```
]

---

# Regular expressions

* The `.` character matches any character (except `\n`)

```{r}
str_view(costumes, ".h.")
```

---

# Regular expressions

* How do you search for a `.`?

--

    * Remember `\` is an escape character

--
    * To create the regular expression `\.`, you need to escape the escape `\`

--
    * To search for a `.`, you need the expression `\\.`
    
```{r}
dot <- "\\."
writeLines(dot)

str_view(c("a.c", "d.f", "ghi"), "\\.")
```

---

# Regular expressions

* How do you search for a `\`?

--
    * `\\\\`

* Search at the beginning of a string with `^`

* Search at the end of a string with `$`

.pull-left[
```{r}
str_view(costumes, "^gho")
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
str_view(costumes, "ost$")
```
]


---

# Regular expressions

* Character classes

    * `\d` - digit
    * `\s` - whitespace
    * `\S` - non-whitespace
    * `[abc]` - matches a, b, or c
    * `[^abc]` - matches everything except a, b, or c

* Recall: `\` is an escape so you need to match `\\d` or `\\s` or `\\S`

* Repetition

    * `?` - zero or one
    * `+` - one or more
    * `*` - zero or more
    * `{n}` - exactly n matches
    * `{n, }` - n or more matches
    * `{, n}` - no more than n matches
    * `{n, m}` - between n and m matches    
    
* Groupings

    * `(abc)` searches for the string "abc

---

# String detection

* Detect whether a string matches a pattern with `str_detect()`

```{r}
str_detect(costumes, "gh")
```

* How many words in the `stringr` library dataset `words` contain `ie` after a `c`?

```{r}
sum(str_detect(words, "cie"))
```

* What proportion of words in `words` begin with a `ch` or a `th`?

```{r}
mean(str_detect(words, "(^ch)|(^th)"))
```

---

# String detection

* What are some of the words that begin with a `ch` or a `th`?

```{r}
# display 5 of these words at random
sample(words[str_detect(words, "(^ch)|(^th)")], 5)
```


* Using `str_subset()`

```{r}
# display 5 of these words at random
sample(str_subset(words, "(^ch)|(^th)"), 5)
```

---

# String detection

* Using `str_detect()` within a data.frame to select words starting with "ch" or "th"

```{r}
df <- tibble(word = words, i = seq_along(word))
df %>% 
  filter(str_detect(word, "(^ch)|(^th)"))
```


---

# String counting

* Count the number of matches using `str_count()`

* Count the number of vowels and consonants in each word

--

```{r}
df %>%
  mutate(
    vowels = str_count(word, "[aeiou]"),
    consonants = str_count(word, "[^aeiou]")
  )
```

---

# Strings examples

* Use the Trump speech data

* A subset of [speeches at Trump rallies](https://www.kaggle.com/christianlillelund/donald-trumps-rallies)

<!-- Example analyses: https://www.kaggle.com/datasciencecat/what-does-trump-talk-about -->

```{r}
file_path <- here::here("data", "Trump_rallies")
all_files <- list.files(file_path, pattern = ".txt")

dat <- list()

for (i in 1:length(all_files)) {
  dat[[i]] <- read_file(paste(file_path, all_files[i], sep = "/"))
}

str_sub(dat[[1]], 1, 200)
```


---

# String splitting

* Use `str_split()` to split the speech into sentences

```{r}
trump_sentences <- unlist(str_split(dat[[1]], "(\\.\\s)|(\\?\\s)"))
head(trump_sentences)
```

* Use the `boundary()` function to split on line breaks, sentences, words, or characters

```{r}
trump_sentences <- unlist(str_split(dat[[1]], boundary("sentence")))
```

* View the words in the first three sentences

```{r}
str_view_all(trump_sentences[1:3], boundary("word"))
```


---

# Extracting matches

* How many sentences contain "Michigan"?

```{r}
has_michigan <- str_subset(trump_sentences, "Michigan")
michigan_mentions <- str_match(has_michigan, "Michigan")
head(michigan_mentions)
```

---

# Extracting matches

* How many sentences contain "because", "Thank", or "you"?

```{r}
words_to_find <- c("because", "Thank", "thank", "you")
words_match <- str_c(words_to_find, collapse = "|")
has_words <- str_subset(trump_sentences, words_match)
mentions <- str_match(has_words, words_match)
head(mentions)
```

* Note: this only returns the first match


---

# Extracting matches

* How to view all the matches?

```{r}
has_words <- str_subset(trump_sentences, words_match)
str_view_all(head(has_words), words_match)
```

---

# Extracting matches

* Extract all matches with `str_match_all()`

.small[
```{r}
head(str_match(has_words, words_match))
head(str_match_all(has_words, words_match))
```
]

---

# Extracting matches

* Format results in a matrix rather than a list

```{r}
head(str_extract_all(has_words, words_match, simplify = TRUE))
```



---

# Grouped matches

* Define a noun as a word that comes after an "a" or a "the"

```{r}
noun <- "(a|the) ([^ ]+)"
has_noun <- str_subset(trump_sentences, noun)
head(has_noun)
```

* Doesn't do too great for nouns but seems ok

```{r}
has_noun %>%
str_extract(noun) %>%
  head()
```


---

# Grouped matches

* `str_extract()` gives complete match, `str_match()` gives the individual groups

```{r}
has_noun %>%
str_extract(noun) %>%
  head()
```

```{r}
has_noun %>%
str_match(noun) %>%
  head()
```


---

# Replacing matches

* Replace matches with `str_replace()` (only replace first instance) and `str_replace_all()`

* Replace Trump speeches vowels with "%"

```{r}
head(str_replace(trump_sentences, "[aeiou]", "%"))
```


```{r}
trump_sentences %>%
  str_replace_all("[aeiou]", "%") %>%
  head()
```




---

# Replacing matches

* Replace multiple matches with `str_replace_all()`

```{r}
trump_sentences %>%
  str_replace_all(c("you" = "me", "Pence" = "%%%")) %>%
  head()
```

---

# Locate strings

* Locate where the strings are with `str_locate()` and `str_locate_all()`

* 
```{r}
head(str_locate(trump_sentences, "Thank"))
```


---

# Factors

* A factor is a "qualitative" variable that is encoded with a "numeric" value

* Types of factors
    * nominal (order doesn't matter) -- colors, religion, etc.
    * ordinal (order matters) -- low/medium/high, young/middle aged/old
    
--
    
```{r}
names <- c("Joe", "Frank", "Prudence", "Cora")
ages <- c("young", "middle aged", "old", "young")
sort(ages)
```
    
* Sorted alphabetically, not by age

```{r}
age_levels <- c("young", "middle aged", "old")
ages_factor <- factor(ages, levels = age_levels)
sort(ages_factor)
```

* much better as a factor

# Working with Factors

* `gss_cat` data in `forcats` package

```{r}
gss_cat
```

        
---

# Working with Factors

* Recode multiple variables

```{r}
gss_cat %>%
  count(partyid)
```

---

# Working with Factors

* Recode multiple variables at one time with `fct_collapse()`

```{r}
gss_cat %>%
  mutate(partyid = fct_collapse(
    partyid,
    other = c("No answer", "Don't know", "Other party"),
    rep = c("Strong republican", "Not str republican"),
    ind = c("Ind,near rep", "Independent", "Ind,near dem"),
    dem = c("Not str democrat", "Strong democrat")
  )) %>%
  count(partyid)

# Dates and times

* dates and times can be really complicated (`lubridate` package)

* many different computer formats (POSIXct is really common)

```{r}
library(lubridate)
today()
now()
```

* How many seconds in a day? In a year?

* What about leap years? Time zones?

# Dates from strings

* Helpful functions: `ymd()`, `ymd()`, `myd()`, `mdy()`, `dym()`, and `dmy()` for year, month, and day

```{r}
ymd("2020-10-31")
mdy("October 31st, 2020")
```

* Can add in time with `_hms()` functions

```{r}
# 6 PM on halloween
ymd_h("2020-10-31 18")
# Right before midnight
ymd_hms("2020-10-31 11:59:59")
```

# Dates

* Process dates with `make_date()` 

```{r}
dat <- data.frame(
  year = c(2012, 2012, 2013, 2013, 2013, 2014, 2016),
  month = c(5, 6, 11, 4, 1, 10, 9),
  day = c(11, 22, 13, 30, 9, 5, 16),
  hour = c(2, 16, 9, 22, 4, 15, 17)
)
```

```{r}
dat %>%
  mutate(date = make_date(year, month, day))
```


---

# Dates

* Process dates with `make_datetime()`

```{r}
dat <- data.frame(
  year = c(2012, 2012, 2013, 2013, 2013, 2014, 2016),
  month = c(5, 6, 11, 4, 1, 10, 9),
  day = c(11, 22, 13, 30, 9, 5, 16),
  hour = c(2, 16, 9, 22, 4, 15, 17),
  minute = c(13, 24, 25, 33, 14, 53, 37),
  second = c(36, 5, 19, 4, 34, 43, 18)
)
```

```{r}
dat_dt <- dat %>%
  mutate(datetime = make_datetime(year, month, day, hour, minute, second))
dat_dt
```

# Converting between dates and date-times

```{r}
today()
as_datetime(today())
```


```{r}
now()
as_date(now())
```

# Dates: Extracting components

* `year()`

* `month()`

* `mday()` (day of the month)

* `yday()` (day of the year)

* `wday()` (day of the week)

* `hour()`

* `minute()`

* `second()`

---

# Dates: Extracting components

```{r}
year(dat_dt$datetime) 
```

```{r}
mday(dat_dt$datetime)
```

```{r}
yday(dat_dt$datetime)
```

```{r}
wday(dat_dt$datetime)

# Dates

* rounding of dates with `floor_date()`, `round_date()`, and `ceiling_date()`

.pull-left[
.very-small[
```{r}
dat_dt %>%
  select(datetime) %>%
  mutate(week_date = floor_date(datetime, "week"))
```

```{r}
dat_dt %>%

# Time spans

* durations 

```{r}
# how long since the Big Lebowski was released?
dude_abiding <- today() - ymd("1998-03-06")
dude_abiding
str(dude_abiding)
as.duration(dude_abiding)
```


---

# Time spans

* duration constructors: `dseconds()`, `dminutes()`, `dhours()`, `ddays()`, `dweeks()`, and `dyears()`

```{r}
ddays(3)
dyears(1)
```

* durations can give strange results

```{r}
# Why still in 2016?
ymd_hms("2016-01-01 01:00:00") + dyears(1)
```

```{r}
# Why did the time change?
ymd_hms("2020-03-08 01:00:00", tz = "America/Chicago") + ddays(1)
```

---

# Time periods

* periods are human-defined terms like weeks and months

* periods can be constructed with: `seconds()`, `minutes()`, `hours()`, `days()`, `weeks()`, and `years()`

```{r}
# Now in 2017
ymd_hms("2016-01-01 01:00:00") + years(1)
```

```{r}
# Time didn't change
ymd_hms("2020-03-08 01:00:00", tz = "America/Chicago") + days(1)
```


---

# Intervals


* What should the result of `dyears(1) / ddays(365)` be?

--

.small[
```{r}
dyears(1) / ddays(365)
```
]

* What should the result of `years(1) / days(1)` be?

--

.small[
```{r}
years(1) / days(1)
```
]

* Could change based on the year!

--

.small[
```{r}
next_year <- today() + years(1)
(today() %--% next_year) ## define a date interval
(today() %--% next_year) / days(1)
(today() %--% next_year) / ddays(1)
```
]

# Time zones

* Time zones are really complex

* Time zones are typically tied to cities

* Get your timzone with `Sys.timezone()`

* Default timezone is UTC

* Get timezones with `OlsonNames()`

```{r}
head(OlsonNames())
```


---

# Time zones

```{r}
x <- ymd_hms("2020-10-31 19:00:00", tz = "America/Denver")
y <- ymd_hms("2020-10-31 20:00:00", tz = "America/Chicago")
z <- ymd_hms("2020-10-31 21:00:00", tz = "America/New_York")
```

```{r}
x - y
x - z
```

```{r}
times <- c(x, y, z)
times
with_tz(times, tzone = "America/Los_Angeles")
```
