# Readings

* R for data science 
    * Introduction
    * Chapters 3 (Data transformation with `dplyr`), 7 (Tibbles with `tibble`), 8 (Data import with `readr`), and 9 (Tidy data with `tidyr`)


---

# The `dplyr` package

* The `dplyr` package can be loaded as part of the `tidyverse` library

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```


* Namespaces
    
    * Different modules might have the same name -- how does the computer know which function you meant?
    
    * In python, you can use the `mean()` function from the `statistics` module using `statistics.mean()`

    * In `R`, namespaces are defined using `::`
    
    * `dplyr::filter()` uses the `filter()` function in the `dplyr()` library
    
---

# `dplyr` functions

* The big 5:

    * Choose observations (rows) based on conditional values with `filter()`
    
    * Reorder the variables with `arrange()`
    
    * Select variables by name with `select()`
    
    * Create new variables with `mutate()`
    
    * Create summary variables with `summarize()` 
        * `summarise()` if you are British
        
---

# Logical operators

* Test if A is greater than B `A > B` 

--

* Test if A is less than B `A < B` 

--

* Test if A is greater than or equal to B `A >= B` 

--

* Test if A is less than or equal to B `A <= B` 

--

* Test if A is equal to B `A == B`

--

* Test if A is not equal to B `A != B`

--

* Return TRUE if both A and B are TRUE `A & B`

--

* Return TRUE if A or B (or both) is TRUE `A | B`

--

* Return TRUE if A in B `A %in% B`

  ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = mean_height, y = mean_mass, color = species)) +
  geom_point() 
```
]

---

# Grouping

* Can `group_by()` multiple variables

* Count the number of penguins observed from each `species` and `island`  

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  group_by(species, island) %>%
  summarize(count = n())
```

---

# Grouping 

* Then `ungroup()` to resume the calculations

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  group_by(species, island) %>%
  summarize(count = n()) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  summarize(total = sum(count))
```


---

# Grouping

* Filter the data to only contain penguin species have 100 observations or more?

--

```{r}
penguins %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  filter(n() >= 100) 
```


---

# Grouping

* Is there a difference in mean `body_mass_g` between penguin `species` on the different `island`s?

--

```{r}
penguins %>%
  group_by(species, island) %>%
  filter(!is.na(body_mass_g)) %>%
  summarize(mean_mass = mean(body_mass_g), 
            count = n())
```


---

# `data.frame`s and `tibble`s

* The default data object in `R` is the `data.frame`

* A `tibble` is a `data.frame` with extra bells and whistles

```{r}
data("iris")
class(iris)

iris_tibble <- as_tibble(iris)
class(iris_tibble)
```


---

# Creating `tibble`s

```{r}
dat <- data.frame(x = 1:5, y = rnorm(5), z = letters[1:5])
glimpse(dat)
```


```{r}
dat_tibble <- tibble(x = 1:5, y = rnorm(5), z = letters[1:5])
glimpse(dat_tibble)
```

---

# Working with `tibble`s

* Better printing of data

* Easier to perform grouping and nesting operations

* Subsetting tibbles
    
    * `$` and `[[` 
    
    * `[[` can subset by variable name or index (counting base starts at 1)
    
    * `$` subsets by variable name only

# Reading files

* Many options to read files

    * Different file types can have different methods to read files
    
* Base `R` options

    * `read.table()`, `read.csv()`, `read.csv2()`, `read.delim()`, `read.delim2()`
    
* Excel file type methods using the `readxl` package

    * `read_excel()`, `read_xls()`, `read_xlsx()`
    
* Reading files using the `readr` package     

    * `read_csv()` reads comma separated value (csv) files
    
        * `read_csv2()` reads semicolon separated files (Europeans and others use `,` instead of `.` in decimal numbers)
    
    * `read_tsv()` reads tab delimited files
    
    * `read_delim()` reads generic delimiter files

# Parsing a file

* When you load a file using `read_*()` functions, `R` guesses which `parse_*()` functions should be applied to each column

```{r}

guess_parser(c(2.5, "3"))

# Writng to files

* Use `write_csv()` to write data to a csv file
    
    * Can load the data with `read_csv()`

* Use `write_rds()` and `read_rds()` to save and load compressed R data files

    * very useful when running long code to save the output to a file

* Use the `feather` package for file types that are compatible with both `R` and `python`
    
    * Cross-language and very fast

* Can check if a directory exists and create it if it doesn't

```{r}
if(!dir.exists(here::here("results"))) {
  dir.create(here::here("results"))
}
```
